### Basics of Algorithms Through Searching and Sorting

|Módulo 1  |10 horas|
|---|---|

In this module the student will learn the very basics of algorithms through three examples: insertion sort (sort an array in ascending/descending order); binary search: search whether an element is present in a sorted array and if yes, find its index; and merge sort (a faster method for sorting an array). Through these algorithms the student will be introduced to the analysis of algorithms -- i.e, proving that the algorithm is correct for the task it has been designed for and establishing a bound on how the time taken to execute the algorithm grows as a function of input. The student is also exposed to the notion of a faster algorithm and asymptotic complexity through the O, big-Omega and big-Theta notations.
